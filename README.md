# 🚀 AI Customer Churn Prediction System

An end-to-end Machine Learning web application that predicts customer churn risk using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and provides real-time insights through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical problem in the banking and telecom industries. This project aims to identify customers who are likely to leave (churn) based on their profile and account details.

The system uses a trained Machine Learning model to analyze user inputs and predict:
- Churn Probability (%)
- Retention Probability (%)
- Risk Category (Low / Medium / High)

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a predictive model using customer data
- Deploy the model as a real-time web application
- Provide an intuitive UI for non-technical users
- Visualize predictions using charts and metrics

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

- Model Used: **Artificial Neural Network (MLPClassifier)**
- Preprocessing: **StandardScaler (feature scaling)**
- Training Data: Customer dataset (bank churn data)
- Output: Binary classification (Churn / Not Churn)

## 🖥️ Application Workflow

1. User enters customer details (credit score, age, balance, etc.)
2. Input data is preprocessed using StandardScaler
3. Trained ANN model predicts churn probability
4. Results are displayed:
   - Churn Risk (%)
   - Retention Chance (%)
   - Risk Level
5. Visualization is shown using charts
